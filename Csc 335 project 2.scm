;; Part 1

;; Design a data type suitable for representing infix propositions, as described in my notes for Class 19.

;; Give a complete specification and development (including a proof) for a program which inputs a proposition
;; which uses and (^), or (v), not (-) and implies (=>) and which returns a logically equivalent proposition
;; using just ^ and - .  Both the input and output should use infix notation.


;; Part 2

;; Give a complete specification and development (including proof) for an interpreter of infix propositions:
;; your interpreter will input a proposition and an a-list of T,F values for variables, and will return the
;; computed value of the input proposition using those values for its variables.


;; Part 3

;; Demonstrate your interpreter by using it in conjunction with the front-end of Part 1.
